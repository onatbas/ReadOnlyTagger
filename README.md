an Evernote/[Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application
For more information, please visit : http://onat.me/onatbas.github.io/Logomakr_2Xu2q4.png

This is a web app to have your notes in evernote read-only. That's something I required frequently thus created an app for it.

Are you deleting valuable information from your notes by mistake? Or simply your upload quote is filing up because opening and closing PDFs, images etc. are treated as uploads? Make your notes read-only with this.

How It Works?
